A twitterbot which wishes you happy birthday! Using Twit API, detects users that are beind congratulated on Twitter. 
Bot randomizes congratulatory message using Fisher-Yates shuffle. 
After congratulating user, user is saved into a database to prevent sending multiple messages to the same user. 

Bot worked for awhile before getting banned for reaching out to users without them reaching out to bot first.
